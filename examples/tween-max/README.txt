The project was about using an API lab and after some discussion and googling we decided to go with Greensock API lab.
basically, It consists of all ease movements with its tween features and nowadays most of the front and developer
are using GreenSock API on their projects. 

Furthermore, it has an additional feature (Slice SVG Text)  that enable the coder to have more control over texts and play around 
with it which is be found in other APIs. In our project we used the extended version of tweenLite, that is tweenMax. Basically
features such as tweenMax.from/to and stagger were really helpful in making the animation and movements. 

My example was graphical bars that rotate to different angles and simultaneously changes its own color after each rotation. the menu buttons control the direction of the rotation.  With the help of Greensock's documentation we were able to drop the graphical bars
from the top position and bouncing back in the middle of Canvas. we also ease the movement of each menu button from the bottom corner
to its original position with a delay of 1 sec.
