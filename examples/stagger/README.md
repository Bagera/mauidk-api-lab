# Stagger

## What does it do?

Instead of animating a group of items all at once, we can recreate this same effect by staggering the animations. When each item's animation is incrementally delayed, they appear as individuals, but still move collectively as a whole.

## Why is it useful?

It saves a lot of time and lines of coding. It also gives a webiste a more "alive" feeling

## How to use the code?

Just link GSAP to the HTML file and and use TweenMax. TweenMax makes it easy to create staggered animations on multiple objects. The animations can overlap, run in direct sequence or have gaps between their start times. TweenMax's three stagger methods: staggerTo(), staggerFrom() and staggerFromTo() are literal one-line wonders.
