# API Lab

We are exploring APIs for our programming 2 course and we have chosen [GreenSock](https://greensock.com/).
GreenSock is an animation library that can animate the DOM or data and can be used with other libraries like PIXIjs to create rich animated graphics.

It's a great library when you need to add motion to interactive prototypes. GreenSock seems to be the industry standard and is battle tested. There are a couple of useful plugins but at a high price.

If you want some of the functionality of the plugins for free you can check out [Anime.js](https://animejs.com/). This library is not as performant, tested or browser compatible, but that may not be a concern.

## Examples

All examples can be run offline without installing any extra dependencies. Just open the index.html in each example folder.

- `examples/tween-light` is an easy tween back and forth.
- `examples/stagger-to-yoyo` is a simple `staggerTo` showing the yoyo effect and infinite repeat.
- `examples/stagger` is a more advanced animation using `TimeLine` to animate with more steps.
- `examples/draw-text` is an example of how you can use animated data to move graphics.
